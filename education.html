        <h3>University of Michigan School of Information - Ann Arbor, MI</h3>
        <h4>Master of Science in Information - Digital Curation, Museum Studies Graduate Certificate, Class of 2020, Cumulative GPA: 4.000</h4>

        <p>In pursuing my career as a professional concerned with special collections, I am currently attending the University of Michigan School of Information. My course work has heavily involved theory based around archiving documents and the preservation of special collections, methods in digital curation, programming, as well as intellectual property and information law. To fufill my internship requirement for my MSI degree, <a href="experience.html">I interned in the archives at the National Gallery of Art in the Summer of 2019.</a> I plan on completing my Master Course in Digital Curation, in which I plan to collaborate in the construction of a database of high-quality images of works of art for scholars. Titled Imago Mundi, it aspires to bring all the metadata and images offered by major museums into one search interface. Each result will offer the highest resolution image available, the copyright status of the image, and a standard set of information about the artwork, with a Chicago-style citation that can be quickly copied and pasted.</p>

        <p>I am also currently completing a one-year graduate certificate in Museum Studies. This program requires the completion of a year-long seminar course focusing on theory and practice, a capstone project, and a three month internship the summer after the completion of the coursework.</p>

        <h3>University of Michigan College of Literature, Science, and the Arts - Ann Arbor, MI</h3>
        <h4>Bachelor of Arts (with Distinction), History Major, Museum Studies Minor, Medieval and Early Modern Studies Minor, Class of 2018, Cumulative GPA: 3.729, Major GPA: 3.775</h4>

        <p>I completed my undergraduate education in History at the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts at the University of Michigan. In accomplishing this degree, I took several courses devoted to Early Modern American history, specifically at the time of colonization. This saw the production of two papers - one focused on the Delaware Prophet/Neolin in the aftermath of the French and Indian War, and another about the Massacre at Fowltown, a precursor to the Seminole Wars. While focusing a majority of my coursework around Colonial America, I also took courses on the Black Death, Chritianity in the Middle East, and Early East Asia.</p>

        <p>While pursuing my Bachelor of Arts, I minored in two subjects. My minor in Medieval and Early Modern Studies allowed me to focus on a very specific point in time around my historical interests, while gaining other knowledge outside of pure historical studies (such as depictions of myth in Renaissance Art). My minor in Museum Studies allowed me to focus on a specific career path. With the overlapping courses I already planned on taking, the required core coursework and internship provided a great foundation for pursuing my dreams as a special collections professional.</p>

        <h4>St. Peter's College Summer School at Magdalen College, Medieval Studies, July-August 2016, A-</h4>

        <p>In between my Sophomore and Junior years of undergraduate study, I had the fortunate opportunity to study at St. Peter's College at the University of Oxford. While there, I studied Medieval British History and completed a seminar on the Arthurian Legend. This program also included weekly site visits related to the moments in history we were studying, as well as a four-day trip to Wales for similar educational reasons.</p>
